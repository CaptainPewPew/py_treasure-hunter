# py_treasure-hunter
A game that I made in python2 for grade 11 computer science class.
It is a game that is similar to mine sweeper.
Plan to add plenty of improvements for fun and to practice SQL.


#TODO
[ ] vim key binding for moving the cursor
    [ ] Keyboard centric controll
    [ ] but also allow for mouse control
[ ] GUI
    [ ] graphics (sprite)
[ ] using SQL to handle scoreboard
    [ ] different scoreboard for different difficulty (3 difficulty)
    [ ] record time and moves made
    [ ] do not need to record the name (kind of like old arcade games)
[ ] Add music and sound effects
[ ] rebalance the game (3 difficulty)
